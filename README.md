## Home

This application was built in my spare time. It's a complete chat platform where you can add contacts and send real-time messages, very simple to use and fully responsive. 

## How to use

To use it, simply create an account and log in. Once logged in, you can utilize the Search option located at the top of the app to search for contacts by email.
